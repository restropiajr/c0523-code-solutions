## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is SQL and how is it different from languages like JavaScript?
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is specifically designed for working with structured data and performing operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data within a database. SQL is primarily focused on data manipulation and retrieval tasks.

  JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for developing dynamic and interactive web applications. While JavaScript can interact with databases, it is not specifically designed for database management like SQL. JavaScript is used primarily for client-side and server-side scripting, user interface development, and other general-purpose programming tasks.

- How do you retrieve specific columns from a database table?
  select "column"

- How do you filter rows based on some specific criteria?
  where "condition" (age > 1)

- What are the benefits of formatting your SQL?

  1. Readability: Proper formatting makes the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for complex queries.
  2. Debugging: Well-formatted queries can help identify syntax errors or logical issues more quickly.
  3. Maintenance: Formatted SQL is easier to maintain and modify in the future, as it is more organized and structured.
  4. Collaboration: Consistent formatting standards make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase.

- What are four comparison operators that can be used in a `where` clause?
  = < > !=

- How do you limit the number of rows returned in a result set?
  limit "number of rows"

- How do you retrieve all columns from a database table?
  select \*

- How do you control the sort order of a result set?
  order by "column" (desc if needed; it is ascended by default)
