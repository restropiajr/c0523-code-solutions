                    Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from
                    both critics and players, with some critics calling it the
                    best installment in the series. It received praise for its
                    large amount of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash
                    gameplay elements, although its online mode was widely
                    criticized.

                    Donkey Kong is a series of video games featuring the
                    adventures of a gorilla called Donkey Kong, conceived by
                    Shigeru Miyamoto in 1981. The franchise consists mainly of
                    two game genres, but also includes additional spin-off tyles
                    of various genres.

                    The games of the first genre are mostly single-screen
                    platform/action puzzle types, featuring Donkey Kong as the
                    opponent in an industrial construction setting.
