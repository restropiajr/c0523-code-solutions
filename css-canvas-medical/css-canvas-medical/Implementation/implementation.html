          <p class="statement"><span>1.</span> Making the Decision To Switch</p>
          <p class="information">
            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
            determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
            unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
            information as possible to make this determination one way or the
            other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application
            for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to
            current customers to talk about their experience.
          </p>

          <p class="statement">
            <span>2.</span> Interfaces and Community Integration
          </p>
          <p class="information">
            Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
            community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
            number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting
            bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred
            specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending
            referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with
            health information exchanges or other information technology vendors
            are important, we will work with you to determine what we can
            deliver and when.
          </p>

          <p class="statement"><span>3.</span> Data Migration</p>
          <p class="information">
            The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
            current data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely
            hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to
            important into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like
            medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
            While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging,
            our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a
            wide variety of EMRs.
          </p>

          <p class="statement"><span>4.</span> Training and Site Visit</p>
          <p class="information">
            We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
            clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based
            trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize
            relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and
            billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team
            can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on
            implementation and training.
          </p>

          <p class="statement"><span>5.</span> Go-Live and Tuning</p>
          <p class="information">
            Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your
            practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely
            depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly.
            There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful of
            encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical
            microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice
            management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.
          </p>

          <p class="statement"><span>6.</span> Sustained Performance</p>
          <p class="information">
            All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises
            and provide support over the long term. Our performance Warranty
            means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the
            agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to
            happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if
            you receive a negative djustment, we will cover it. And for
            everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect
            this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
