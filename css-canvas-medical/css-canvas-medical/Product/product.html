              Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
              clinicians, staff, and patients themselves - making you more
              productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into
              your practice of medicine

                Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you
                never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
                interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

                &#34;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance
                dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to
                use. The right information is presented in the right away at the
                right time, and the product leverages technology to actually
                improve the quality of care I provide.&#34;

                Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your
                entire patient panel, so you know who needs extra help and how
                best to give it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of
                your population with proactive interventions, and take comfort
                knowing you're a step ahead.

                &#34;Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a
                test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on
                potentially unsafe levels of opiods according to the most recent
                guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are
                tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get an
                answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead.&#34;

              <p>
                Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you
                understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve
                quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates
                quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on
                more complex work only they can do.

                &#34;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as
                complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to
                keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality
                team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in
                Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and
