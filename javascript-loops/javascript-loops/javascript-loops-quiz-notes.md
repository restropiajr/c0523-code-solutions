- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The 'initialiation' expression of a 'for' loop gets evaluated once in the beginning of the loop.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The 'condition' expression of a 'for' loop gets evaluated each time in the beginning of the loop.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The 'final' expression of a 'for' loop gets evaluated at the end of an iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  Besides a 'return' statement, the keyboard break, exista a loop before its 'condition' expression evaluates to 'false'.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The '++' increment operator takes increments the variable that its paired with by 1 and then reassigned the result back into the variable.
