## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSX?
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension syntax for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is commonly used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  Developers write JSX code, which looks like HTML, within JavaScript files. During the build process, JSX is transpiled into plain JavaScript using tools like Babel. The transpiled code creates React elements, which are lightweight JavaScript objects representing the component structure. React uses these elements to build a virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and efficiently updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes.
