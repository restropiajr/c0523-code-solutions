- What is an "event" in React?
  A specific action or occurrence that takes place, such as a user clicking a button, typing in an input field, or a component finishing its rendering. These events can be detected and handled within React components to trigger specific behavior or execute functions.

- What is an "event handler"? Which component declares the handler?
  A function that is responsible for handling an event when it occurs. It defines the behavior or actions that should be performed in response to the event. The component that declares the event handler is the one that provides the implementation of the function to handle the event.

- How do you pass an event handler to a React component?
  By treating the event handler function as a prop.

- What is the naming convention for event handlers?
  Use a descriptive name starting with "handle" followed by the name of the event or action being handled.

- What is an "event handler prop"? Which component declares the prop?
  A prop that is used to pass an event handler function from a parent component to a child component. The parent component declares and provides the event handler function, and the child component receives it as a prop and uses it when needed to handle specific events.

  Based on its specific functionality.
