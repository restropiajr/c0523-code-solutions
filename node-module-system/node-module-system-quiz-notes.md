## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a JavaScript module?
  A JavaScript module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality. It allows you to organize and separate code into reusable and maintainable units. Modules can contain variables, functions, classes, or any other code entities.

- What are the advantages of modular programming?

  1. Organizes code into smaller manageable chunks of code.
  2. Resusability since modules can be imported and exported and be used in different applications.
  3. Maintenance since the structure of the modules can be isolated from each other when it comes to testing and debugging.

- In JavaScript, how do you make a function in a module available to other modules?
  Export the function (named export or default export) at the declaration of the function.

- In JavaScript, how do you use a function from another module?
  import the function at the top of the module (use exact name if it was named export or use any variable name if it was default export).
