## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  It allows you to destructure properties of an object or elements of an array into individual variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {property} = object

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [variable] = array

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  The destructuring has the property/variables on the left side of the assignment operator and the name of the object/array on the right side. Object/array literals have it the opposite.
