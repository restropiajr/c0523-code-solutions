- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
  Storing information about a program in variables is better than only storing it in the DOM because using variables is easier to store and manipulate data while storing it in the DOM may be slower due to the complex data structure it has.
