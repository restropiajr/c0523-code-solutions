## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a database schema?
  A database schema is a logical structure that defines the organization, relationships, and constraints of a database. It represents the blueprint of how data is organized and stored in the database. It defines the tables, their fields (columns), data types, relationships between tables, and any constraints or rules that govern the data.

- What is a table?
  In the context of a relational database, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. It is the fundamental structure for storing data. Each table in a database has a unique name and consists of columns (also called fields) and rows (also called records or tuples).

- What is a row?
  A row, also referred to as a record or tuple, represents a single instance of data in a table. It is a horizontal entity within a table and contains values for each column defined in the table's schema. Each row is uniquely identified by a primary key, which is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies the row within the table.

- What is an attribute and what other names are used to describe them?
  An attribute, also known as a column or field, represents a specific data element or property within a table. It defines the type of data that can be stored in that column and provides a name for referencing and identifying the data. Attributes hold the actual values for each instance of data in a table.
