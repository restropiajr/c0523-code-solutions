## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `express.json()` middleware do and when would you need it?
  The express.json() middleware in Express is used to parse JSON data from the request body. It is a built-in middleware that is responsible for automatically parsing incoming JSON request bodies and making the parsed data available in the req.body object for further processing in your route handlers.

  You would need the express.json() middleware when you want to handle JSON data in your Express application without manually parsing the request body. It simplifies the process of working with JSON data, allowing you to focus on processing the data rather than dealing with parsing details.
