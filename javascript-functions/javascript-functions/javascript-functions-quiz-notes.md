## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  To define a function, the following steps must be performed:

  1. Insert the keyword function with an optional name and a list of optional parameters.
  2. Insert the beginning curly bracket '{'.
  3. Write the specific code block for the function. If a return statement is needed, include this to what is required for the code block.
  4. Insert the ending curly bracket '}' after the block code is done.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  To call a function, the following step must be performed:

  1. Insert the name of the function and call it out with the optional arguments (if applicable).

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function definition sets up the code block for the specific task and uses parameters as the template for the code block while a function callout passes arguments inside the function to execute the code block.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is the placeholder being declation inside a function while the argument is the value of what is being passed with the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are placeholders that can be used inside the code block for the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Two effects a 'return' statement have on the behavior of a function is that it returns the result of the code block and exit's the code block.
