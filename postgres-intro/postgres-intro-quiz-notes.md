## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do we use databases in Web development?

  1. Data Storage: Databases provide a structured and organized way to store data for web applications. They enable developers to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.

  2. Data Integrity: Databases offer mechanisms to enforce data integrity constraints, such as ensuring data consistency, uniqueness, and referential integrity. These constraints help maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data.

  3. Scalability: Databases provide the ability to handle large amounts of data and support concurrent access by multiple users. They offer optimizations for performance, indexing, and query optimization, allowing web applications to scale as the data and user base grow.

  4. Data Persistence: Databases allow data to persist even when the web application or server restarts. This ensures that valuable information is not lost and can be retrieved when needed.

  5. Security: Databases provide features to secure data, such as user authentication, access control, and encryption. These security measures help protect sensitive information in web applications.

- What is PostgreSQL and what are some alternative relational databases?
  PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its robustness, scalability, and adherence to SQL standards. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of advanced features, including ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, multi-version concurrency control, and support for various data types. It is widely used in web development due to its reliability and extensive feature set.

  MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL, SQLite

- What are some advantages of learning a relational database?
  Widely Used: Relational databases are used extensively in various industries and web development projects. Learning how to work with databases opens up a wide range of job opportunities.

  Structured Data Management: Relational databases provide a structured approach to store and manage data. Understanding how to design and work with databases allows you to handle complex data relationships efficiently.

  Querying and Data Manipulation: Learning SQL (Structured Query Language) enables you to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data effectively. SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.

  Scalability and Performance: Understanding database design principles and optimization techniques helps improve application performance and scalability. You can optimize queries, create indexes, and design efficient database schemas.

- What is one way to see if PostgreSQL is running?
  In terminal, enter sudo service postgresql status
