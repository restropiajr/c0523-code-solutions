After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a directory?
  A directory, also known as a folder, is a container in a file system that can hold files and other directories. It provides a way to organize and store files in a hierarchical structure. Directories can contain subdirectories, allowing for a nested structure of files and directories.

- What is a relative file path?
  A relative file path is a file path that is specified relative to the current working directory or another known reference point. It indicates the location of a file starting from a given directory or file. Relative file paths do not start with the root directory or drive letter.

- What is an absolute file path?
  An absolute file path is a file path that provides the complete and exact location of a file in the file system. It specifies the path starting from the root directory or drive letter, all the way down to the specific file. Absolute file paths uniquely identify the location of a file.
